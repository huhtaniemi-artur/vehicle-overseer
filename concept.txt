web-based minimalist app. webui uses current technology; likely webpack with node.js backend and react or vue on frontend, but use a simpler stack if it satisfies requirements.

webui:
- simple, touch-capable, mobile-friendly (primary use on phone).
- shows dynamic items (rectangular balloons).
-- press to expand; on release, present selection of one or more ip addresses.
--- after ip selection, request confirmation (confirm or cancel; cancel also by tapping outside selection box).
-- there are green balloons and gray balloons (gray listed after green); color indicated via lit corners.
-- entries also show last-seen value: seconds since last update, then friendlier format for longer (e.g., 1m, 1h, days).
-- shows currently selected ip address.
--- selectable ip addresses come from an internal predefined list (config possibly opened by dragging page from very top edge downward, not just scrolling).
- gray items do not present ip selection option.
- on every update from remote machine (api receives json), entry briefly lights light-green then quickly fades.

backend:
- public api receives (post) json object {vin/name, ip-address, state, data}.
-- each time an object is received, add a new webui entry in real time or update existing one identified by vin/name.
--- new objects are added on top; each object times out after 10s, becomes gray, and moves below green items.
- when target ip is selected and confirmed, run ssh script using entry's current ip. script runs remotely, takes selected ip as argument, modifies string "mqttserverip": "tcp://10.102.2.10:11883" in file /path/properties.json by replacing ip only, leaving other content unchanged. then reboot ford usrapp.service on target machine.

service:
- service sends name and ip every 3s: tun0 ip address; vin/name taken from properties.json; state read from mqtt topic or service logs (to be clarified); data empty. service depends on network.
- example vin location:
...
 "vehicleProperties": {
        "vin": "DEMO_01",
...

advanced:
each entry has "usrapp.service" link that opens page with live stdout stream from target machine. log is retrieved from machine over ssh with "sudo -S journalctl -xefu usrapp --output=cat" command by backend and transmitted to users over websocket to client webui.
